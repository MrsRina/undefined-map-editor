# phobos
Phobos was a game made in week to a game jam (Game JaaJ 2021), this game is made in SDL2 (pygame) & OpenGL Legacy.

To execute (only windows):
```
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/MrsRina/phobos-game-pygame.git

# go to path or find folder manually.
cd \build\v0.1\phobos\ && start 64x.bat
```

**OBS: YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE PYTHON INSTALLED, BECAUSE THE GAME USE PYTHON EMBED PACKAGE.**
**OBS: THE ORIGINAL REPO WAS NUKED (CONFLICT)**

# info
I did not finish the game, but I made one map editor workable, you can use this base to create your game.

# map editor
Start map editor, add tiles or add your texture, you can set the mode of rendering in modes (GL legacy).
You can select pressing mouse on tile, resizing (to prevent many tiles), I made create 1k tiles in screen.
